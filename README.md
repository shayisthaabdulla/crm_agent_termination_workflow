# Project: Agent Termination Workflow Automation in Dynamics 365

## Overview
The agent termination process involved automatic closure of the “Account” entity but required manual closure of associated entities like Opportunities, Quotes, Cases, and Orders. Manual tasks, including communicating with the Media team and handling refunds for Paid Search and DMF orders, were time-consuming and error-prone. This project aimed to automate the closure of related entities and notifications to reduce manual effort, improve data accuracy, and ensure timely communication to avoid unnecessary costs.

## Business Problem
Manual handling of agent termination processes led to inefficiencies and errors. The need was to automate the closure of associated entities—Opportunities, Quotes, Cases, and Orders—and improve communication with the Media team for timely and accurate program termination.

## Solution
Designed and implemented a Dynamics 365 workflow that automatically handled agent termination including:
- Closing related opportunities, orders, and quotes
- Updating agent records
- Triggering necessary notifications

## Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM
- Power Automate
- Business Rules & Workflows

## Business Impact
- Saved 48+ hours annually for the Account Coordination team
- Reduced manual errors
- Improved compliance and process consistency

## Why This Project Matters
Automating the agent termination process saved 4 hours monthly, reduced manual errors, and ensured timely communication with the Media team. This improved operational efficiency and data accuracy at scale.
